Concept of Hooks in React
Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components. Prior to hooks, functional components were stateless and couldnâ€™t manage state or lifecycle methods like class components. With hooks, developers can write more concise, maintainable, and reusable code.

Types of Hooks
React provides several built-in hooks:
1.useState: Manages state in functional components.
2.useEffect: Handles side effects (similar to lifecycle methods in class components).
3.useContext: Manages context.
4.useReducer: Handles complex state logic.
5.useRef: Provides access to DOM elements or creates mutable objects.
