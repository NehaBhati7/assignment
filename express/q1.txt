Express.js is a lightweight, fast, and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a set of tools, features, and middleware.

Key Features of Express.js:
1.Minimalist and Unopinionated:
It provides the essential features for building web servers and APIs but leaves most architectural decisions to the developer.
2.Middleware Support:
Middleware functions allow you to process requests and responses before sending the final output.
3.Routing:
Provides an easy way to define routes for handling HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
4.Integration:
Easily integrates with various template engines (e.g., Pug, EJS) for rendering dynamic HTML.
5.Extensibility:
Supports the use of third-party libraries and plugins to extend its functionality.
6.Performance:
Built on Node.js, it inherits the asynchronous, non-blocking architecture for high performance.


Why is Express.js Commonly Used in Web Development?
1. Simplifies Server-Side Development:
Without Express, creating a Node.js server requires writing a lot of boilerplate code. Express streamlines this process by providing tools for handling routing, middleware, and HTTP requests/responses.
2. Scalability:
Its lightweight and modular architecture make it easy to scale applications by adding middleware or additional routes.
3. Versatility:
Express is suitable for building RESTful APIs, single-page applications (SPAs), and full-stack web applications.
4. Middleware Ecosystem:
There is a vast library of middleware available for tasks like authentication, logging, and parsing request bodies (e.g., body-parser).
5. Active Community and Ecosystem:
With a large and active community, itâ€™s easy to find tutorials, tools, and libraries for almost any functionality.
