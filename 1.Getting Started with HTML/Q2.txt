Q.2.Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML document.

ANS- Purpose of Comments in HTML:
     Comments in HTML are non-executable lines of code that are ignored by the browser. They are used to add notes and explanations directly within the code, making it more readable and understandable, especially for:
     * Documentation: Explaining the purpose of specific code sections or elements.
     * Collaboration: Communicating with other developers about the code's intent or potential issues.
     * Debugging: Temporarily disabling parts of the code to isolate problems.
     * Future Reference: Reminding yourself of the code's logic or intended behavior.

     Example of Using Comments in HTML:
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>HTML Comments Example</title>
     </head>
     <body>

         <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

         <div>
             <p>Another paragraph of text.</p>
         </div>

     </body>
     </html>
