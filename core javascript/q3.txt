Loops are control structures in programming used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is met. They are essential for tasks where you need to perform repetitive actions without writing the same code multiple times.

Why Do We Need Loops?
1. Efficiency: Avoid writing repetitive code.
2. Automation: Automate tasks like iterating over arrays, processing data, or executing calculations.
3. Dynamic Behavior: Handle tasks with unknown or changing input sizes, like reading user input or processing files.
4. Maintainability: Improve code readability and reduce redundancy.

Types of loops :
1. For Loop
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

syntax:
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be executed
}
example:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration number:", i);
}


2. While Loop
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.

syntax:
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
example:
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log("Iteration number:", i);
    i++;
}


3.Do-While Loop
The do-while loop ensures the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

syntax:
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
example:
let i = 1;
do {
    console.log("Iteration number:", i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
