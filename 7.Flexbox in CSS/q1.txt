Q1. Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When would you choose to use one over the other?

ANS- Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout)
     Key Characteristics:

     1.One-dimensional layout:
       Flexbox is designed to lay out items in a single dimensionâ€”either a row (horizontal) or a column (vertical).
       Items are aligned along a main axis and a cross axis.

     2.Content-driven layout:
       Flexbox adjusts the size and position of items based on the available space and their content.

     3.Alignment and spacing:
       Flexbox excels at distributing space between items and aligning them within a container.

     4.Responsive design:
       Flexbox is great for components or layouts that need to adapt to varying content sizes dynamically.

       When to use Flexbox:
       -For simple, linear layouts (e.g., navigation bars, buttons in a toolbar, or forms).
       -When the layout involves a single row or column of elements.
       -When you need content to align or distribute dynamically based on available space.


     
     Grid (CSS Grid Layout)
     Key Characteristics:

     1.Two-dimensional layout:
       CSS Grid allows you to work in both rows and columns, making it suitable for more complex layouts.

     2.Layout-driven design:
       The layout can be defined explicitly with rows and columns, even without considering the content size.

     3.Precise control:
       Grid offers more granular control over placement with features like grid lines, areas, and template definitions.

     4.Explicit structure:
       You can define a layout with rows, columns, and gaps, creating a structured, modular design.

       When to use Grid:

       -For complex, structured layouts (e.g., web pages, dashboards, or multi-column/multi-row designs).
       -When you need to define both rows and columns explicitly.
       -When you want a layout to remain consistent regardless of content size.



      Choosing Between Flexbox and Grid
      Use Flexbox when:

      -You need to arrange items in a single row or column.
      -The layout depends on content size.
      -The design requires flexible alignment and spacing adjustments.

      Use Grid when:

      -You need a structured layout involving multiple rows and columns.
      -You require precise control over element placement.
      -The layout should remain consistent across different screen sizes.
